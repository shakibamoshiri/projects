# :material-numeric-2-box-multiple: lanscale

Lanscale is based on SoftEther VPN version 5 and IaaC concept. I use it to setup
multiple SE5 servers quickly. I just update the YAML configuration file and run
it (like an Ansible playbook)


## source code

It is available on [https://github.com/shakibamoshiri/lanscale](https://github.com/shakibamoshiri/lanscale)
