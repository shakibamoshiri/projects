# :material-numeric-1-box-multiple: somacss

The **somecss** was inspired by facing some issues when I wanted to make some
carousels using JavaScript. I was looking for a solution that could make infinite
carousels which can hold as many items as possible and it should be compatible
will all browsers. I ended up writing in CSS using SASS and it is pure CSS, working
without the need for JavaScript!
