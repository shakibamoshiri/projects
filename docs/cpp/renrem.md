# :material-numeric-3-box-multiple: renrem

Efficiency and not wasting time have been my main concern for years. Since I was
renaming and removing files a lot for versus tests, I had to **rename** or **remove**
them in bulk. So `renrem` renames or removes files in bulk based on regex (Regular Expressions)

!!! note
    Since regex library in CPP was not as complete as I wanted, I ended up
    using **boost** library
